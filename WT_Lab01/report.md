# Lab 01 Report

In this **lab 01**, I learned how to create and manage files using Git. I started by creating an *HTML* file and added a welcome message. Then, I learned how to use comments in *HTML*, which helps make the code more understandable.

I also created a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files and folders, and added a license file for the project. Creating and deleting files using Git showed me how file tracking works.

Working with branches was a new and interesting experience. I saw how changes can be made separately and then merged back into the main project. Overall, this lab helped me understand the basic workflow of Git and how useful it is for managing code.

My name is **Waqas Khan**, and my registration number is **24pwbcs1141**. I am a web developer and an AI learner. This lab helped me understand the basics of using Git for version control, which is very useful for both *web development* and *AI* projects.
